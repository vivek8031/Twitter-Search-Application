<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><span>Guidelines for Code</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Each team must create a project on Github with 694, year (2023), their team # in the project name. Code must be checked into Github. Add the TAs to the project (TAs will share their Github username).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><span>Teams will be the same as in Mini Project.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Expected number of hours/week/person: (this is just a ballpark to serve as a baseline)</span></div>
<div><span>1st-2nd week: 8 hours</span></div>
<div><span>3rd week: 10 hours</span></div>
<div><span>4th,5th week: 12 hours/week</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The guidelines for the project are below. Note that not all parts of the project are completely specified. This is by design. You have the freedom to define the parts of the project that are unspecified. Note that you must discuss your choices and their implications in the report and presentation.&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>1.</strong> A Twitter dataset will be provided for the project. You may also collect your own Twitter dataset. Provide a summary report of #users, #tweets, and other facets (such as urls etc.) in your data.</div>
<div><strong>2.</strong> Store the information in the tweets in at least 2 datastores (one relational and another non-relational). The structure of a collected tweet can be quite complex.<span style="color: #0e4ff5;"> </span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #0e4ff5;">You may drop fields that are not relevant to your search application.</span> </span>A suggested design is to store the user information in a relational store and the tweets in a non-relational store. You need to figure out how to store actions on a tweet such as retweets. Your goal is to efficiently store the data for fast access. Use indexes, where possible, to speed up access. You must load the tweets into the datastore using Python code that processes the tweets one at a time (you will be simulating the processing of data that is arriving in a stream.)</div>
<div><span style="color: #0e4ff5;">You cannot use NoSQL or TinyDB. You may use PostgreSQL, MySQL, Couchbase, MongoDB, ...</span></div>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Design and implement a cache for storing "popular" (frequently accessed) data so that this data does not have to be retrieved from the database each time it is accessed. <span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Some hashtags/users may be popular and their data may be cached. </span>You can use a Python dictionary for implementing the cache, but you must limit the size of the dictionary by evicting entries using a strategy (E.g. least accessed). <span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;<strong>You must checkpoint your data on disk at periodic intervals. When your search application starts up, you must reload the state of the cache from the disk.</strong> Questions to consider - </span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Can an entry in the cache get stale (is not representing the correct state)? How will you update or purge stale data? An advanced feature that you could implement is an expiry mechanism for an entry in the cache by having a Time-To-Live field for each entry that determines the amount of time the entry will be retained in the cache.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><strong>4.</strong> Design a search application for your tweet store. You must provide several options such as search by string, hashtag,&nbsp; and user at the minimum. Allow for a time range in these searches. You will also need some notion of relevance to rank the search results. Provide for some drill-down search features such as the following: When the search results for a string/hashtag/user are returned, you will likely be showing the tweets that matched the search query. Show the meta-data for each tweet such as (a) the author of the tweet,&nbsp; (b) when it was tweeted, (c) how many times it was retweeted. If the user clicks on the number of times it was retweeted, show the information about the retweets (who retweeted, when etc.). If the user clicks on the author, show other tweets by that author or retweets by that author (if available). How you store your information will impact the response times of your query. You must discuss this (in your presentation and report).&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additionally, provide the option for at least 2 "top-level" metrics such as the top 10 users and top 10 tweets.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that a fancy search interface is not needed. Any interface that allows the user to specify their query is enough.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Run a test set of representative queries and measure timings (with cache where appropriate and without cache).</p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Each team member must work on a distinct part of the project but team members must collaborate through discussions. E.g., the first person can work on the relational datastore, the second person on the non-relational datastore, the third person on the cache, and the fourth person on the search application. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Everyone has to write code.</strong></span> Each person must develop a set of routines that other team members can use. For instance, the person who is responsible for the relational datastore can provide a set of routines that can update and query the datastore for a user's information. The code must clearly document who wrote the code.&nbsp;</p>
